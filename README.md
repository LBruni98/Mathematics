### Probability Theory

#### The probability of a random integer being divisible by 5
To Calculate the probability of a random interger being divisible by 5, you'll first have to take note of each of the numbers that end in 5 and of course these numbers can be divided by 5; 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, basically the 5 times table. Numbers in between are not probable to be dividable by 5 and hence, this gives the probability 1/5.

####  How to calculate the greatest common divisor and least a common multiple of a given pair of numbers
GCD means the **G**reatest **C**ommon **D**ivisor which is the largest number that divides any given numbers. To calculate this, let's say I needed to find the GCD of both 45 and 54. I would first need to find the divisors of these numbers. The divisors are as followed...
* 45: 1, 3, 5, *9*, 15, 45
* 54: 1, 2, 3, 6, *9*, 18, 27, 54

Next would be to find the greatest number, which is the highest number that is shared in the two lists. Here, the number is *9*.

LCM means the **L**east **C**ommon **M**ultiple and this is the smallest number that is basically a mulitple of any given number. So, if I were to find the LCM of both 6 and 8, the first thing I would do would be to run by the multiples of both numbers. Here they are as followed...
* 6: 6, 12, 18, *24*, 30, ...
* 8: 8, 16, *24*, 32, 40, ...

Next would be to find the smallest matching number from both lists, which would be *24*.

### Integral Calculus to Solve Practical Problems Involving Area
This is a branch of mathematics that is deals with properties and application of intergrals, which in turn is the space under a graph or area of curvature and applying this can aid in describing or finding displacement or area of said space.
